## Look and Color Scheme
GreenSeed's color scheme is designed to evoke the natural world and promote a sense of serenity and calm. The main colors used on the site are shades of green and terracotta, with accents of woody and earthy tones.

The top of the site features a vibrant shade of green, which gradually becomes darker and more woody as you scroll down the page. This color transition is meant to mimic the natural progression from the top of a tree down to its roots.

In addition to the main colors, GreenSeed also uses wavy, organic lines to add a sense of movement and liveliness to the site. These lines are meant to evoke the growth and motion of plants, and help to create a cohesive, natural aesthetic.

Overall, the color scheme of GreenSeed is meant to convey the company's commitment to nature and sustainability, while also providing a visually appealing and calming shopping experience for customers.
